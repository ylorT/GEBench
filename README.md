## 🖥️ What is GEBench?

GEBench is a software tool designed to test and compare how well different image generation models work in graphical user interface (GUI) environments. It helps users understand the performance of models that create images by following prompts.

### Key Points About GEBench:

- It supports five types of data tests, including single-step and multi-step prompts.
- The software automatically switches between Chinese and English prompts, depending on folder setup.
- It uses five different criteria to measure performance: goal, logic, consistency, user interface quality, and overall image quality.
- The software is built to work without coding knowledge.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

Before installing GEBench, make sure your computer fits these basic requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.14 or later, or a modern Linux distribution.  
- **Processor:** 2 GHz dual-core or better.  
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM. 8 GB or more is recommended for smooth operation.  
- **Storage:** Minimum 500 MB free space for the software, plus extra space for data and outputs.  
- **Screen:** 1024x768 resolution or higher.  
- **Internet Connection:** Required only to download the program and model data if needed.

## 🔧 How to Run GEBench

After installing:

1. Open the GEBench app by clicking its icon from your Start menu, Applications folder, or desktop.  
2. The main window shows the benchmark options.  
3. Select which image generation model you want to test or use the default option.  
4. Choose the type of test from the five data types:  
   - Single-step prompts  
   - Multi-step prompts  
   - Text-fictional app environment  
   - Text-real app environment  
   - Grounding tasks  
5. Click “Start Benchmark” to begin.  
6. Wait for GEBench to finish the tests. It will show scores in five areas: goal completion, logic, consistency, UI, and image quality.

## 📂 Understanding the Data Types

GEBench organizes testing data into five different types to cover a range of image generation challenges:

1. **Single-step:** The model generates images based on one prompt without additional steps.  
2. **Multi-step:** The model follows a sequence of prompts, testing how well it continues a task.  
3. **Text-fictional app:** Prompts describe an imaginary app interface to see if the model can create accurate GUI screens.  
4. **Text-real app:** Prompts are from actual application descriptions, measuring realistic GUI output.  
5. **Grounding:** Tests if the model grounds images properly to the prompts’ context and meaning.

## 🌐 Language Support

GEBench automatically chooses between Chinese and English prompts by using folder names. This lets users test models in both languages without changing settings manually.

For example:
- A folder with `CN` in its name will trigger Chinese prompt sets.  
- A folder with `EN` will use English prompt sets.

This feature makes it easy to benchmark models in different languages with the same tool.

## 📊 Performance Metrics Explained

GEBench scores models on five main areas. Each one tells you how well the image generation model did during tests:

- **Goal:** Did the generated image meet the main goal of the prompt?  
- **Logic:** Are the elements in the image arranged in a logical and reasonable way?  
- **Consistency:** Does the image stay consistent across multiple steps or closely related prompts?  
- **UI (User Interface):** How accurate and clear is the GUI design in the generated image?   
- **Quality:** The overall look and polish of the image, including resolution and detail.

The results show strengths and weaknesses for each model in understandable terms.

## 🛡️ Privacy and Security

GEBench runs locally on your computer. It does not collect or send your data over the internet, except when downloading updates or data sets.

Your data and tests remain private. The software asks for permission before connecting online.
