"""Evaluation prompts for different data types."""

TYPE1_EVAL_PROMPT = """GOAL (Goal Achievement): Does the generated state achieve the caption-described change?
5: Caption change is achieved completely and unambiguously. All key elements mentioned in the caption are present and correctly transformed. No ambiguity about
whether the change matches the description. 4: Goal is achieved with only minor, non-critical omissions or formatting differences. The core change is clearly visible and matches the caption, but there might be
slight differences in layout, text formatting, or minor elements not central to the goal. 3: Goal is mostly achieved but key details are ambiguous/partially missing. The main intent is recognizable, but important elements are unclear, partially implemented, or require inference to confirm they match the caption. 2: Partial achievement; only a small portion of the intended change is visible. Most of the expected transformation is missing or incorrect, though some elements
loosely relate to the caption. 1: Barely related; the change does not match caption semantics. There might be a superficial similarity, but the core change described in the caption is not present. 0: Complete failure; no relevant change or totally wrong change. The generated image shows either no change from the initial state or a change completely unrelated
to the caption. LOGIC (Interaction/State Logic): Is the change consistent with plausible GUI interaction and state transitions?
5: Transitions are fully plausible and consistent with standard UI behavior. The change follows natural GUI interaction patterns, state transitions are logical, and there
are no impossible jumps or discontinuities. The transformation looks like a real UI would behave. 4: Mostly plausible; minor implausibility but still credible. The overall transition makes sense, but there might be slight inconsistencies that don't break the
believability of the interaction (e.g., slightly accelerated animation, minor state inconsistency). 3: Some implausible elements; still partially coherent. The change shows recognizable UI logic in parts, but contains elements that don't follow standard interaction
patterns or have logical gaps that require assuming missing intermediate steps. 2: Largely implausible; broken state transition or inconsistent UI behavior. The change shows significant logical problems, such as abrupt "teleportation" between
unrelated states, contradictory UI element behaviors, or changes that would require impossible user actions. 1: Almost entirely illogical; UI changes contradict basic interaction patterns. The transformation violates fundamental UI principles, shows elements
appearing/disappearing without cause, or demonstrates behaviors that no real GUI would exhibit. 0: Impossible; severe "teleportation" or nonsensical transformation. The change is completely disconnected from any plausible UI interaction, showing random or
meaningless state changes that cannot be explained by any reasonable user action sequence. CONS (Consistency/Preservation): Are unrelated regions preserved from the Initial Image?
5: Unaffected regions are preserved nearly perfectly. Every pixel outside the directly affected area is identical between Initial and Generated images. No drift, no color
changes, no subtle alterations in preserved elements. 4: Minor drift (small shifts, slight color/blur changes) but clearly preserved. The preserved regions remain recognizable and functionally identical, though there might
be nearly imperceptible changes due to compression or anti-aliasing artifacts. 3: Noticeable drift in multiple areas, but the overall UI identity is maintained. Elements outside the target region may shift slightly, show minor color variations, or
have subtle blur, but the general layout and all UI components remain identifiable and in approximately correct positions. 2: Significant unintended changes outside the target region. Background elements show obvious movement, text changes in supposedly unchanged areas, or layout
modifications that weren't part of the intended change. The preservation is clearly imperfect. 1: Widespread unintended changes; most of the UI is altered. Large sections of the UI that should remain unchanged show visible differences, with elements moving, changing appearance, or being corrupted across the screen. 0: Entire screen is corrupted or replaced. No meaningful preservation of unchanged regions; the entire UI appears transformed, broken, or replaced with unrelated
content.
UI (UI Plausibility/Integrity): Are UI elements plausible (no hallucinations, broken layout, impossible widgets/states)?
5: UI components are coherent, correctly structured, and look native. All elements follow platform conventions, proper layering is maintained, states are correct, no
visual anomalies, and text is perfectly rendered. The interface looks like it could be a real, professional GUI. 4: Mostly coherent; minor layout/element issues. The UI generally follows platform conventions with only subtle anomalies. There might be minor layering issues, slight misalignment, or small state inconsistencies, but overall it resembles a usable interface. 3: Several element/layout issues but still resembles a usable UI. Some UI elements appear slightly off (wrong sizes, minor misalignment, occasional text artifacts) but
remain recognizable and the interface still appears functional despite the issues. 2: Many hallucinations or severe layout problems. Multiple UI components show significant problems: incorrect states, major layering errors, impossible layouts, or
generated elements that don't exist in real UIs. The interface integrity is compromised. 1: UI is mostly broken; elements are nonsensical. Most UI components are incorrect, showing impossible states, major layering violations, or hallucinated controls
that make no sense in the context. Very few elements appear correct or usable. 0: UI is unusable or completely hallucinated. The interface shows no recognizable UI elements, contains completely impossible layouts, hallucinated controls that
violate all design principles, or appears as random visual noise rather than a coherent interface. QUAL (Visual Quality): Visual readability (text/icon clarity, artifacts). 5: Crisp, readable, no obvious artifacts. Text and icons have sharp edges, perfect color accuracy, no compression artifacts, and professional rendering quality
throughout the image. 4: Very readable; minor blur/artifacts. Text and icons remain clear and legible, with only slight compression artifacts or minimal edge blurring that doesn't affect
readability. 3: Readable but noticeable blur/artifacts in important areas. Text is mostly readable but shows some artifacts, icons may be slightly blurry, and there might be minor
color distortions in critical regions. 2: Significant quality degradation; text/icons hard to read. Obvious artifacts throughout the image, significant blurring of important elements, color issues, or
compression noise that interferes with reading text or recognizing icons. 1: Severe artifacts; most text is unreadable. Major quality problems throughout, extensive blurring, strong color distortions, or heavy compression artifacts make most
text illegible and icons unrecognizable. 0: Completely unusable image quality. Extreme artifacts, total blur, meaningless color shifts, or severe corruption make the image completely unreadable and
unusable for any UI evaluation purpose

GOAL (Final Goal Achievement): Does Frame 5 achieve the global goal?
5: Perfect achievement - Frame 5 shows EXACTLY what Global Goal describes, all objectives fully met with no ambiguity. The final state precisely matches the
intended outcome described in the goal. 4: Strong achievement - Final goal achieved with only minor omissions or slight deviations that don't affect core objectives. Frame 5 accurately reflects the goal with
only non-critical details missing or slightly different. 3: Partial achievement - Some aspects of final goal met, but important elements are missing or incorrectly implemented. Frame 5 shows progress toward the goal but
key components are absent, wrong, or ambiguous. 2: Weak achievement - Only minimal progress toward final goal, most key objectives not met. Frame 5 barely resembles the intended outcome, with most critical
elements missing or wrong. 1: Minimal achievement - Almost no progress toward final goal, only superficial similarity. Frame 5 might share some basic UI structure but shows virtually no
meaningful progress toward the stated objective. 0: No achievement - Frame 5 completely unrelated to final goal or shows wrong outcome. The trajectory ends in a state that contradicts or has no meaningful
connection to the global goal. LOGIC (Interaction Logic Coherence): Are Frame0→5 transitions plausible and consistent with GUI interaction?
5: Perfect logic - Every interaction step is natural and reasonable, with coherent step-by-step progression and no jumps. Each frame logically follows from the
previous one, showing realistic UI state transitions without teleportation or impossible changes. The entire trajectory demonstrates a believable user interaction flow. 4: Strong logic - Mostly natural progression with minor logical gaps, but overall interaction makes sense. The trajectory is mostly coherent, though there might be one
or two slightly abrupt transitions that are still plausible within GUI interaction patterns. 3: Partial logic - Some steps follow expected flow, but several show logical jumps or unclear causation. The trajectory has noticeable gaps where it's unclear how one
frame transitions to the next, requiring assumptions about missing intermediate states or actions. 2: Weak logic - Frequent logical inconsistencies across frames, progression is confusing. Multiple frames appear disconnected, showing "teleportation" between
unrelated UI states, or transitions that contradict normal GUI behavior patterns. 1: Minimal logic - Actions barely follow expected flow, most steps are disconnected. The trajectory shows little coherent progression, with frames that seem
randomly ordered or only loosely related to each other, making the interaction pattern unclear. 0: No logic - Frame-to-frame changes are completely disconnected and meaningless. The trajectory appears as a random sequence of unrelated UI states with no
discernible interaction logic or coherent progression. CONS (Visual Consistency Across Frames): Are UI elements stable across all 5 frames?
5: Perfect consistency - ALL UI elements (system bars, layout, style, colors) remain completely stable across all frames, zero drift. Every unchanged component
maintains identical position, appearance, and state throughout the entire trajectory. No flicker, no subtle shifts, perfect stability. 4: Strong consistency - Minor variations in some elements (slight color shifts, subtle positioning) but core UI remains stable. Background elements might show
nearly imperceptible changes, but all major components stay consistent and recognizable across frames. 3: Partial consistency - Noticeable drift in some UI elements between frames, but major components remain recognizable. Some elements shift position, change
color slightly, or show minor flicker, but the overall UI structure and identity is maintained. 2: Weak consistency - Significant inconsistencies across frames: layout shifts, style changes, unstable UI elements. Background components move noticeably, colors
change substantially, or there's clear flicker/corruption in multiple frames affecting UI stability. 1: Minimal consistency - UI changes substantially across frames, few elements remain stable, major visual drift. Most background elements show significant
movement or change, with only a few components maintaining their position/appearance throughout the trajectory. 0: No consistency - Completely different UI across frames, no recognizable stability or coherent interface. Each frame appears to show a different UI layout, style, or
completely unrelated interface elements with no continuity.
UI (Element Integrity): Are UI components in each frame native-looking and coherent?
5: Perfect integrity - All UI components follow platform conventions, proper layering, correct states, no visual anomalies, text perfectly rendered in EVERY frame. Every frame shows professional-quality UI that looks indistinguishable from a real native application interface. 4: Strong integrity - UI mostly follows conventions with minor layering issues or subtle anomalies, text mostly clear across frames. There might be occasional minor
issues like slight misalignment or subtle rendering problems, but overall UI quality remains high in all frames. 3: Partial integrity - Some UI elements appear slightly off (wrong sizes, minor misalignment, occasional text artifacts) but still plausible in most frames. The UI
remains recognizable and generally functional despite several noticeable imperfections across the trajectory. 2: Weak integrity - Noticeable UI problems in multiple frames: incorrect states, layering errors, text clarity issues, minor hallucinations. Multiple frames show
significant UI defects that affect the believability and usability of the interface. 1: Poor integrity - Significant UI breakdown across frames: impossible states, major layering violations, unreadable text, clear hallucinations. Most frames contain
serious UI problems that make the interface appear broken or nonsensical. 0: No integrity - UI completely nonsensical across frames, with hallucinated controls, impossible layouts, or no recognizable interface elements. The trajectory shows
no coherent UI structure, appearing as random visual elements rather than a functional interface. QUAL (Visual Quality): Are text/icons readable and artifacts minimal across all frames?
5: Excellent quality - Crystal clear text/icons in ALL frames, sharp edges, no compression artifacts, perfect color accuracy. Every frame shows professional
rendering quality with crisp, easily readable text and sharp iconography throughout. 4: Good quality - Text/icons clear and readable across frames, minor compression artifacts or slight blurring at edges only. Slight quality degradation may be visible
but doesn't affect readability or overall visual quality. 3: Fair quality - Text mostly readable but shows some artifacts in multiple frames, icons slightly blurry, minor color distortions. Quality issues are noticeable and
affect some regions, but important text and icons remain legible. 2: Poor quality - Text becoming difficult to read in several frames, noticeable artifacts, significant blurring, color issues. Quality degradation is substantial and affects
readability of important UI elements in multiple frames. 1: Very poor quality - Text barely legible across frames, severe artifacts, major blurring throughout, strong color distortions. Most text is extremely difficult or
impossible to read, with major quality problems affecting the entire image. 0: Unusable quality - Text completely unreadable in most frames, extreme artifacts, totally blurred, colors meaningless. The visual quality is so poor that the UI
cannot be evaluated or used for any practical purpose.

5: Perfect logic - Every action naturally and plausibly causes the visual changes described in the Visual Description, with coherent step-by-step progression. Each
action-result pair is believable and follows natural GUI interaction patterns without requiring unexplained assumptions. 4: Strong logic - Actions mostly lead to expected visual changes, minor logical gaps but overall progression makes sense. The action-visual alignment is mostly

- Correct UI outcome happened (e.g., dialog opened, dropdown expanded, tab switched, checkbox toggled, page navigated). - Direction is correct (open vs close, enable vs disable, selected vs unselected). - If Expected Effect mentions specific text labels/selected items, they must be visible and correct for 4-5. - If Expected Effect implies a very specific screen/state, wrong screen/state caps goal at 2. LOGIC (Trigger Localization): Is change plausibly triggered by tapping given point/region?
5: Perfect localization - Change originates PRECISELY from tapped element/region with appropriate ripple effects and spatial reasoning. 4: Strong localization - Change originates from area very close to tap point, minor spatial offset but clearly connected and plausible. 3: Partial localization - Change appears in vicinity of tap but connection is ambiguous or spans multiple unrelated UI elements. 2: Weak localization - Change appears in entirely different region from tap point, showing poor spatial understanding. 1: Minimal localization - Only trace evidence that change might relate to tap location, mostly disconnected. 0: No localization - Change completely unrelated to tap location or affects random/global areas without spatial coherence. Logic checklist:
- Change should be anchored to tapped widget/region or its plausible dependent area. - Plausible: button→modal/dialog, tab→content panel, menu item→navigation, toggle→state change. - Implausible: unrelated far-away changes, global theme swaps, random text/icon rewrites, unexplained page jumps.
